		QMetry Automation Framework - <small>Powerful Automation
			Platform for Test Authoring, Test Execution and Execution Analysis</small>
	</h1>
	QMetry Automation Framework provides a powerful and versatile platform to author Test Cases in
	Behavior Driven, Keyword Driven or Code Driven approach. It helps to
	significantly reduce costs involved in setting up Test Automation at
	any organization. It is a right tool for Web Platform, Mobile Platform
	(Native, Mobile Web, HTML5,etc) and Web Service test automation
	solution using Selenium and other related technologies. QMetry
	Automation Framework benefits any QA Team in developing highly
	maintainable and repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets,
	proper modularity and semantic structure. Descriptive Reporting
	satisfies high-level as well as low-level (debugging) aspects.


	<p>
		QMetry Automation Framework is designed to solve common industry
		problems related to testing complex web systems. The framework is best
		suited for writing Automated Web, Mobile Web and Mobile Native
		Application UI Tests simulate real user activities on the page. <br />

		The framework is built upon java and integrates TestNG,
		Selenium/Webdriver, Appium and Perfecto. Due to the framework's
		thorough design, test developer does not need to worry about common
		tasks such as thread safe browser session for running test in
		parallel, reporting or to incorporate result with test management
		tools. The tests run can be configured through standard testing
		configuration files, the test run filters and behavior can be changed
		within the config File. <br /> The architecture of the framework
		ensures a low cost of maintenance while supporting extensibility by:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Abstracting the technical implementation away from the
			operational components</li>
		<li>Following accepted design patterns in creating the core
			functionalities within the framework.</li>
		<li>Providing an approach to develop highly maintainable and
			repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity
			and semantic structure. Framework has readymade services for
			assertions, browser, reporting and data. Also, framework concept is
			based on page services so your page and related actions will be
			reusable from any test case. There is a good logging functionality
			and screen shot facility for assertions.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Features</h2>
	QMetry Automation Framework supports integrations with Test Management
	Platform (QMetry, Rally, ApTest, HP ALM, etc), Continuous Integration
	Systems (Jenkins, Bamboo, etc), Mobile Device Cloud Solutions
	(SauceLabs, Perfecto Mobile, etc).

	</ul>
	<p>
		Question over here is how the framework reduces maintenance, execution
		time and reuses code?<br /> QMetry Automation Framework 
		provides high level construct to satisfy automation needs. It includes
		top level interfaces, abstract base classes, service classes and their
		implementations and custom annotations. Test developer only need to
		concentrate on writing the tests and not spend time on adjusting the
		underlying framework.<br /> This framework provides test page concept
		in a best efficient way by which you can manipulate page navigation
		same as on actual web application under test. Once page get created
		page objects/functionalities can be used in any test case, makes code
		more reusable. The framework takes care of not only launching that
		page but the entire page hierarchy to reach that specific page.
		Furthermore it also checks that is page already active in browser? If
		so then it will continue from there, results in reduced execution
		time. <br /> When functionality changes only the specific test page
		file needs to be updated: if there is any change in page/ui of web
		application under test you need to update just in particular page
		rather than each and every test case, thus result in less maintenance.
		<br /> In case of sequential execution it will take advantage of
		sharing browser sessions between multiple test cases. No special
		coding or design required to run test in parallel, you just need to
		set parallel attribute&rsquo;s appropriate value in configuration file
		(eg. false, Test, methods, classes) and framework will take care for
		providing thread safe driver sessions with maximum level of sharing
		driver session between multiple test cases.&nbsp; This will result in
		reducing time by parallel processing as well as by some level of
		sharing driver session(depends on configuration). You also can
		configure to run parallel in different browser (eg. iexplorer,
		firefox) with or without selenium grid. If you are not planning for
		physical distributed selenium server then, without selenium grid, you
		can achieve higher performance by the framework as compare to grid
		that configured different selenium server instance on the same
		physical machine.
